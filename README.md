# Recipies

### Directions

Fork this repo and create an app where I am able to do the following tasks

- I want to be able to create an ingredient where I can input a name, description, and a food group (Protein, Vegetable, Fruit, Grain, Dairy)
- I want to be able to create a recipe where I can input a name, a description, and choose which ingredients go into the recipe.
- I want to be able to search for ingredients by name or food group when creating a recipe
- I want to be able to edit my recipe's name, description, and ingredients (I want to search in my edit page too)
- I want vegetarian recipies (has no protein ingredients) to be marked differently than recipies with protein.
- When I look at a recipe I want my ingredients to be sorted by the food group (Protein, Vegetable, Fruit, Grain, Dairy) they belong to.
